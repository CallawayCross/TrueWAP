Title: True Range-Weighted Average Price (TrueWAP)
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Joshua Callaway
Maintainer: Joshua Callaway <Callaway@roar-analytics.com>
Description: This groundbreaking technical indicator directly integrates volatility into price averaging by weighting median range-bound prices using the True Range.  Unlike conventional metrics such as TWAP, which focuses solely on time, or VWAP, which emphasizes volume, TrueWAP captures fluctuating market behavior by reflecting true price movement within high/low performance boundaries.
